2025-06-12 09:53:30,640 [INFO] ðŸ“„ Cleaning summary:
The data cleaning process appears to have been highly effective, as demonstrated by the reduction in the number of missing values from 866 to 0, while maintaining the original dataset shape of (891, 12). Here's a brief summary of the process and its impact:

1. **Preservation of Data Integrity:** The fact that the shape of the dataset remained unchanged indicates that no rows or columns were removed during the cleaning process. This suggests that the cleaning was primarily focused on imputing or resolving missing values rather than deleting data.

2. **Handling Missing Values:** The reduction of missing values from 866 to 0 implies that the missing data was addressed, possibly through imputation techniques such as filling with mean, median, mode, or using more advanced methods like K-Nearest Neighbors or regression imputation.

3. **Data Consistency and Completeness:** By eliminating missing values, the dataset is now more complete and consistent, which can enhance the quality and reliability of the analysis that will be conducted
